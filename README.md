## Concept

Building a blog engine!
Your app must allow non-technical users to write blog posts.
When a visitor visits your site, they should see content.
When a user logs in, they should see a dashboard that lets them create and edit new posts.
Blog posts should have comments.

## Screenshots

The Login/Register inputs are on the index.

After you browse all Posts you will see an option to Create a new Post, tho it will not let you Publish unless you have logged in.

When you click any Post in the list it will display that Post by itself.

When a Post is displayed by itself it will have an edit button.
